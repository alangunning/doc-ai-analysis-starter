In the opinion of the Company's management, the condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary for fair financial statement presentation. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ('GAAP') requires the use of management estimates. These condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the Company's annual consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 28, 2024 (the '2024 Form 10-K').</p>

<p>(1) The valuation techniques used to measure the fair values of the Company's Level 2 financial instruments, which generally have counterparties with high credit ratings, are based on quoted market prices or model-driven valuations using significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.</p>
<p>(2) As of September 28, 2024, cash and cash equivalents included $2.6 billion held in escrow and restricted from general use. These restricted cash and cash equivalents were designated to settle the Company's obligation related to the 2016 European Commission (the 'Commission') decision that Ireland granted state aid to the Company (the 'State Aid Decision'), which was confirmed during the fourth quarter of 2024 by the European Court of Justice in a reversal of the 2020 judgment of the European General Court.</p>

<h2>Derivative Instruments and Hedging</h2>
<p>The Company may use derivative instruments to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk. However, the Company may choose not  to  hedge  certain  exposures  for  a  variety  of  reasons,  including  accounting  considerations  or  the  prohibitive  economic  cost  of  hedging  particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or interest rates.</p>
<h2>Foreign Exchange Rate Risk</h2>
<p>To protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Company may use forwards, options or other instruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months.</p>
<p>To protect the Company's foreign currency-denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Company may use forwards, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of June 28, 2025, the  maximum  length  of  time  over  which  the  Company  is  hedging  its  exposure  to  the  variability  in  future  cash  flows  for  term  debt-related  foreign  currency transactions is 17 years.</p>
<p>The Company may also use derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to protect gross margins from certain fluctuations in foreign exchange  rates,  as  well  as  to  offset  a  portion  of  the  foreign  currency  gains  and  losses  generated  by  the  remeasurement  of  certain  assets  and  liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.</p>
<h2>Interest Rate Risk</h2>
<p>To protect the Company's term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may use interest rate swaps, options or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges.</p>
<p>The notional amounts of the Company's outstanding derivative instruments as of June 28, 2025 and September 28, 2024, were as follows (in millions):</p>

<h2>Vendor Non-Trade Receivables</h2>
<p>The Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to these vendors who manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these components directly from suppliers. The Company does not reflect the sale of these components in products net sales. Rather, the Company recognizes any gain on these sales as a reduction of products cost of sales when the related final products are sold by the Company. As of June 28, 2025, the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 48% and 14%. As of September 28, 2024, the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 44% and 23%.</p>

<h2>Business Seasonality and Product Introductions</h2>
<p>The Company has historically experienced higher net  sales  in  its  first  quarter  compared  to  other  quarters  in  its  fiscal  year  due  in  part  to  seasonal  holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company's net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction.</p>
<p>During the third quarter of 2025, the Company announced iOS 26, macOS Tahoe 26, iPadOS 26, watchOS 26, visionOS 26 and tvOS 26. ® ® ® ® ®</p>
<h2>Macroeconomic Conditions</h2>
<p>Macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, interest rates and currency fluctuations, have directly and indirectly impacted, and could in the future materially impact, the Company's results of operations and financial condition.</p>
<h2>Tariffs and Other Measures</h2>
<p>Beginning in the second quarter of 2025, new tariffs were announced on imports to the U.S. ('U.S. Tariffs'), including additional tariffs on imports from China, India,  Japan,  South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam and the European Union ('EU'), among others. In response, several countries have imposed, or threatened to impose, reciprocal tariffs on imports from the U.S. and other retaliatory measures. Various modifications to the U.S. Tariffs have been announced and further changes could be made in the future, which may include additional sector-based tariffs or other measures. For example, the U.S. Department of Commerce has initiated  an  investigation  under  Section  232  of  the  Trade  Expansion  Act  of  1962,  as  amended,  into,  among  other  things,  imports  of  semiconductors, semiconductor manufacturing equipment, and their derivative products, including downstream products that contain semiconductors. Tariffs and other measures that are applied to the Company's products or their components can have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition, including impacting the Company's supply chain, the availability of rare earths and other raw materials and components, pricing and gross margin. The ultimate impact remains uncertain and will depend on several factors, including whether additional or incremental U.S. Tariffs or other measures are announced or imposed, to what extent other countries implement tariffs or other retaliatory measures in response, and the overall magnitude and duration of these  measures.  Trade  and  other  international  disputes  can  have  an  adverse  impact  on  the  overall  macroeconomic  environment  and  result  in  shifts  and reductions  in  consumer  spending  and  negative  consumer  sentiment  for  the  Company's  products  and  services,  all  of  which  can  further  adversely  affect  the Company's business and results of operations.</p>

<h2>Liquidity and Capital Resources</h2>
<p>The Company believes its balances of  cash,  cash  equivalents  and  marketable  securities,  along  with  cash  generated  by  ongoing  operations  and  continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond.</p>

<h2>PART II - OTHER INFORMATION</h2>
<h2>Item 1.    Legal Proceedings</h2>
<h2>Digital Markets Act Investigations</h2>
<p>On March 25, 2024, the Commission announced that it had opened a formal noncompliance investigation against the Company under Article 5(4) of the EU Digital Markets Act (the 'DMA') (the 'Article 5(4) Investigation'). The Article 5(4) Investigation relates to how developers may communicate and promote offers to end  users  for  apps  distributed  through  the  App  Store,  as  well  as  how  developers  may  conclude  contracts  with  those  end  users.  On  June  24,  2024,  the Commission  announced  that  it  had  opened  an  additional  formal  investigation  against  the  Company  regarding  whether  the  Company's  new  contractual requirements for third-party app developers and app marketplaces may violate the DMA (the 'Article 6(4) Investigation'). On April 23, 2025, the Commission fined the Company €500 million in the Article 5(4) Investigation and issued a cease and desist order requiring the Company to remove technical and commercial restrictions that prevent developers from steering users to alternative distribution channels outside the App Store. The Company has appealed the Commission's Article  5(4)  decision. Also  on April  23,  2025,  the  Commission  issued  preliminary  findings  in  the Article  6(4)  Investigation.  If  the  Commission  makes  a  final determination in the Article 6(4) Investigation that there has been a violation, it can issue a cease and desist order and may impose fines up to 10% of the Company's annual worldwide net sales. The Commission may also seek to impose additional fines if it deems that the Company has violated a cease and desist order. The Company believes that it complies with the DMA and has continued to make changes to its compliance plan in response to feedback and engagement with the Commission.</p>
<h2>Department of Justice Lawsuit</h2>
<p>On March 21, 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice (the 'DOJ') and a number of state and district attorneys general filed a civil antitrust lawsuit in the U.S. District  Court  for  the  District  of  New  Jersey  against  the  Company  alleging  monopolization  or  attempted  monopolization  in  the  markets  for  'performance smartphones'  and  'smartphones'  in  violation  of  U.S.  antitrust  laws.  The  DOJ  is  seeking  equitable  relief  to  redress  the  alleged  anticompetitive  behavior.  In addition,  various  civil  litigation  matters  have  been  filed  in  state  and  federal  courts  in  the  U.S.  alleging  similar  violations  of  U.S.  antitrust  laws  and  seeking monetary damages and other nonmonetary relief. The Company believes it has substantial defenses and intends to vigorously defend itself.</p>
<h2>Epic Games</h2>
<p>Epic Games, Inc. ('Epic') filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the 'California District Court') against the Company alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws and California's unfair competition law based upon the Company's operation of its App Store. The California District  Court found that certain provisions of the Company's App Review Guidelines violate California's unfair competition law and issued an injunction (the '2021 Injunction')  enjoining  the  Company  from  prohibiting  developers  from  including  in  their  apps  buttons,  external  links,  or  other  calls  to  action  that  direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than the Company's in-app purchase system. The 2021 Injunction applies to apps on the U.S. storefronts of the iOS and iPadOS  App Stores. On January 16, 2024, the Company implemented a plan to comply with the 2021 Injunction and filed a statement of compliance with the California District Court. On September 30, 2024, the Company filed a motion with the California District Court to narrow or vacate the 2021 Injunction. On April  30,  2025,  the  California  District  Court  found  the  Company  to  be  in  violation  of  the  2021  Injunction  and  enjoined  the  Company  from  imposing  any commission or any fee on purchases that consumers make outside an app; restricting, conditioning, limiting, or prohibiting how developers guide consumers to purchases  outside  an  app;  or  otherwise  interfering  with  a  consumer's  choice  to  proceed  in  or  out  of  an  app.  The  California  District  Court  also  denied  the Company's  motion  to  narrow  or  vacate  the  2021  Injunction  and  referred  the  Company  to  the  U.S.  Attorney  for  the  Northern  District  of  California  for  a determination whether criminal contempt proceedings are appropriate. The Company will continue to vigorously defend its actions and employees, and has appealed the California District Court's most recent decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (the 'Ninth Circuit Court'). Although the Company's request to stay the decision pending appeal was denied, the Ninth Circuit Court has agreed to consider the Company's appeal on an expedited basis, with arguments scheduled for October 2025. ®</p>
<h2>Other Legal Proceedings</h2>
<p>The Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. The Company settled certain matters during the third quarter of 2025 that did not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company's financial condition or operating results. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for  amounts above management's expectations, the Company's financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.</p>
<h2>Item 1A.    Risk Factors</h2>
<p>The Company's business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including those described in Part I, Item 1A of the 2024 Form 10-K and Part II, Item 1A of the Forms 10-Q for the quarters ended December 28, 2024 (the 'first quarter 2025 Form 10-Q') and March 29, 2025 (the 'second quarter 2025 Form 10-Q'), in each case under the heading 'Risk Factors.' When any one or more of these risks materialize from time to time, the Company's business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be materially and adversely affected. Except for the risk factors disclosed in Part II, Item 1A of the first quarter 2025 Form 10-Q and the second quarter 2025 Form 10-Q, which are hereby incorporated by reference into this Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q, there have been no material changes to the Company's risk factors since the 2024 Form 10-K.</p>
